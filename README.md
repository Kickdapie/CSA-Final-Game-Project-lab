# CSA-Final-Game-Project-lab
This is the final project of my AP CSA Class. I created a game where an object that moves around a street. Every mouse click plays a sound, use 'W' and 'D' to move up and down, and the comments in the project should help 
you understand how the project works better. *This is a beginner's project*.
